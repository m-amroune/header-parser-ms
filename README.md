##  About the Project

**Objective** : Build an API that returns information from the request headers, including IP address, language, and software details.  
This project is part of FreeCodeCamp’s Back End Development and APIs Certification and is completed using Node.js and Express in a cloud-based development environment.

- Define a route `/api/whoami` that:
  - Returns a JSON object with `ipaddress`, `language`, and `software` properties
  - Extracts data from the request headers
- Pass all automated tests provided by FreeCodeCamp
- Deploy the project to a cloud platform (Replit)
